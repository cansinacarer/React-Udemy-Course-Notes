This repo contains the files I used while following the Udemy course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Steps to run:

1. Install modules with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm start`.
